      Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
    </h2></center>

    <p>
      Most people infected with the <em>COVID-19</em> virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the <em>COVID-19</em> virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>COVID-19</em> virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette <strong>(for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</strong>

    <h2 id="T1">Prevention</h2>
    To prevent infection and to slow transmission of COVID-19, do the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
      <li>Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.</li>
      <li>Avoid touching your face.</li>
      <li>Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.</li>
      <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
      <li>Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.</li>
      <li>Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="T2">Symptoms</h2>
    <p>
      COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.

    <h2 id="T3">Frequently Asked Questions & Answers</h2>

    <h3>What happens to people who get COVID-19?</h3>
    <p>
      Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care.
Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys.
In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection.
    </p>

    <h3>Who is most at risk of severe illness from COVID-19?</h3>
    <p>
      People aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, obesity or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.
  However, anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.
    </p>

    <h3>Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?</h3>
    <p>
      Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms.
WHO is working with our Global Technical Network for Clinical Management of COVID-19, researchers and patient groups around the world to design and carry out studies of patients beyond the initial acute course of illness to understand the proportion of patients who have long term effects, how long they persist, and why they occur.  These studies will be used to develop further guidance for patient care.
    </p>

    <h3>How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?</h3>
    <p>
      Stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds and close contact, regularly cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!
    </p>

    <h3>When should I get a test for COVID-19?</h3>
    <p>
      Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, infected may also consider testing – contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance.
    While a person is waiting for test results, they should remain isolated from others. Where testing capacity is limited, tests should first be done for those at higher risk of infection, such as health workers, and those at higher risk of severe illness such as older people, especially those living in seniors’ residences or long-term care facilities.
